# DINAMO
DINAMO (DINAMO Is Not A MOdified blackbody) is a dust heating and emission code for astrophysics, 
described in Priestley, Barlow & De Looze (in prep).
Given dust optical properties, the local radiation field and the gas density and temperature, 
DINAMO calculates the equilibrium temperature distribution for each grain size in a specified 
size distribution, accounting for collisional heating by electrons and atoms/ions as well as 
radiative heating, stochastic heating effects and non-continuous cooling, 
and the resulting emitted spectral energy distribution. DINAMO has been benchmarked 
against other dust emission codes as described in Camps et al. (2015).
